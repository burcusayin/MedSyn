**Here is the clinical note for the patient:** '''{clinicalNote}'''.

### Instructions:
1. Begin by requesting an initial evaluation of the patient from Dr. Lee.
2. Engage in a collaborative discussion to confirm the patient’s diagnosis. Please note that Dr. Lee has access to a more detailed clinical note, so you MUST consult to Dr. Lee to obtain the necessary information for making the diagnosis.
3. You are not allowed to consult to another chief physician; so do not try to schedule appointments with third parties. You can only interact with Dr. Lee.
4. You are not allowed to ask for additional tests. You should evaluate the patient only based on the given clinical note, and your discussion with Dr. Lee.
5. Keep in mind that you have limited time for every patient. Please avoid duplicate recommendations, conversations, and questions related to treatments. Keep each message CONCISE and to the point. 
6. Once you have gathered sufficient information and are confident in the diagnosis, stop the discussion with Dr. Lee and write the patient’s discharge text.
7. The discharge text should include only the `diagnosis` and `codes` fields:
    - `diagnosis` field should specify the patient's final diagnosis. Please note that you should decide the final diagnosis.
    - `codes` field should list the ICD-10 codes corresponding to the diagnosis specified in the `diagnosis` field. Please do not add any explanation for the codes.
8. Remember to refer to your discussion with Dr. Lee and the clinical note while writing the discharge text. Ensure that the `diagnosis`, and `codes` fields are complete and unambiguous; they must not be left empty or unclear.
9. Do NOT ask Dr. Lee to check or write your dischargeText. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to write and submit the dischargeText.
10. Return your dischargeText using the TOOL `discharge_text_tool`. Do NOT mention the TOOL `discharge_text_tool` to Dr. Lee.
