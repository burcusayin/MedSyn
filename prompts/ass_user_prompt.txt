**Here is the clinical note for the patient:** '''{clinicalNote}'''.

### Task:
Thoroughly analyze the clinical note and provide a structured summary that includes:
- Key symptoms: Highlight notable symptoms that may require further investigation.
- Preliminary diagnosis: Offer an initial diagnosis based on the patient’s symptoms and medical history.
- Potential complications: Identify any critical issues or risks Dr. Ellis should consider.
- Recommendations: Suggest further evaluations if uncertainties remain about the patient’s condition.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure your evaluation is clear, precise, and structured to facilitate an informed discussion. 
2. In each round of the discussion, limit yourself to a CONCISE message.
3. Keep in mind that you have limited time for every patient. Please avoid duplicate recommendations, conversations, and questions related to treatments.
4. You are not allowed to consult to another chief physician; so do not try to schedule appointments with third parties. You can only interact with Dr. Ellis.
5. You are not allowed to ask for additional tests. You should evaluate the patient only based on the given clinical note.

### Process:
You will first receive a message from Dr. Ellis, asking for your initial assessment. Afterward, you can follow up in each discussion round to collaboratively refine the diagnosis.
